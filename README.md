# Dugit

GitHub Classroom tools for Drury University.

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/dugit.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/dugit)

## Todo

- [ ] Put development guide in the repo
- [ ] Add testing somehow (use dugit-testing-classroom with the dugit org, and setup for edge cases)
- [ ] Consider replacing local git cloning with workflows
- [ ] Create dugit organization and move the project there
- [ ] Clean up / standardize exports, consider a different folder structure
- [ ] Wrap API function structure
- [ ] Consider limiting grades to one per assignment (prob not cuz sprints, but maybe)
- [ ] Sort imports
- [ ] Test with older versions of Node
- [ ] Rename instances of repository to repo
- [ ] Shorten anonymous to anon?
- [ ] Address freezing when hitting stop after adding a grade? Have to hit ctrl c to kill
- [ ] Catch grader username doesn't exist errors
- [ ] Replace simple-git with write file for teacher and grader repos
- [ ] Check if creating a classroom without an org is possible, if so catch error
